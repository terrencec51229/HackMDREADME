# About Myself

[TOC]

## <span class="fontColorH2">Find Your Greatness and Keep Your Faith</span>

This slogan is excerpted by [Nike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYP9AGtLvRg) and I just want to remind myself whenever I look at it. We are not only just to find out what are we good at, but also have to keep growing up continuously although slowly.

We have been involved in the new era of mixed territories, such as networking, security, storage, and virtualization. They are not standalone anymore, closed to each other instead. Therefore, my goal is not only to keep what I have been familiar with, but also to learn what is news, and evaluate if it is worth to try to optimize the existing environment or resolve the known issues. To be not just a Networking!

## <span class="fontColorH2">The Driver of Write-down</span>

As of today, I have been benefited from several useful blogs such as [Nicholas Russo](http://njrusmc.net/), [Cody Hosterman](https://www.codyhosterman.com/), and even any contents could be found by Google. I have had an idea to push my notes to be readable since a long time ago, therefore, I might be able to assist someone in the future as well as those guys. The progress is not so fast, but I will fill this place as my best as possible.

Intrinsically, all of my posts would much focus on Networking and Cloud spaces.
